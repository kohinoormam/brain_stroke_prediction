 Brain Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning
 Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke using patient demographic and health-related features. It follows a complete data science workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.

Problem Statement
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Early prediction of stroke risk can support preventive healthcare and reduce mortality.

Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:

* Age
* Gender
* Hypertension
* Heart disease
* Average glucose level
* BMI
* Smoking status
* Stroke (Target: 0 = No Stroke, 1 = Stroke)

Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Workflow

1. Data loading & inspection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, missing values)
4. Model training (Logistic Regression)
5. Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)

How to Run

bash
git clone https://github.com/kohinoormam/brain_stroke_prediction.git
cd brain_stroke_prediction
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
jupyter notebook ALassignment.ipynb
